# ML Book Club 

Bi-weekly machine learning book club, reading the [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) book by Ian Goodfellow. 

### Housekeeping Rules

  1. We read Ian Goodfellow's [book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/). The idea is to cover a chapter in each meeting (or at least half). We could also read chapters from Yoav Goldberg's [book](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~yogo/nnlp.pdf) on neural nets because it focuses on NLP applications.
  2. The meetings are bi-weekly, 2h slots, Wednesdays 3-5. First meeting 6/11.
  3. If you wish to attend, **please make sure that you have read and tried to understand the chapter in advance**.
  4. The reading material for the next meeting is announced at the end of the most recent meeting.
